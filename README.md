# Hello, I'm Ivan Rebolledo

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a self-taught **Front-End Developer** I enjoy building real-world applications using modern web technologies.

## About Me

I'm always exploring new ways to improve as a developer, currently focusing on **React**, **TypeScript**, **Unit testing** and writing clean, maintainable code.

I'm actively learning:
- **best front-end practices** with guidance from my mentor [Martin Stadler](https://mentorcruise.com/mentor/martinstadler/?queryID=b9e92f8896ce0ca6073026eac3ac3a7c&source=search)  
- **Data structures and algorithms** through 1:1 tutoring with [Greem L.](https://www.wyzant.com/match/tutor/89018372)

I also enjoy **collaborating on real-world team projects** at [Chingu](https://www.chingu.io/), where I contribute to full development cycles using Agile workflows.

Outside of coding, I love hiking with my miniature poodle and Latin dancing on the weekends.
