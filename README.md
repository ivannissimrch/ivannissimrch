# Hi, I'm Ivan Rebolledo

**Frontend Developer | React • TypeScript • Next.js**

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a self-taught **Front-End Developer** focused on building scalable and maintainable real-world applications using modern web technologies like **React** and **TypeScript**.

I love working on the logic, structure, and state flow of React apps.

I have 8 months of experience working in **collaborative Agile environments** through [Chingu](https://www.chingu.io/), where I've contributed to full development cycles as part of international dev teams.

## Currently Building

- Prototyping an ESL shadowing app to help English learners practice speaking and intonation

## Open to Opportunities

I'm actively looking for junior front-end roles. Let’s connect and build something meaningful!

## About Me

- Data structures and algorithms through 1:1 tutoring with [Greem L.](https://www.wyzant.com/match/tutor/89018372)

Outside of coding, I love hiking with my miniature poodle and Latin dancing on the weekends.
