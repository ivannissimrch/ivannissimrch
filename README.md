# Hi, I'm Ivan Rebolledo

**Frontend Developer | React • TypeScript • Next.js**

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a self-taught **Front-End Developer** passionate about building scalable, maintainable real-world applications using modern web technologies like **React** and **TypeScript**.

I have 8 months of experience working in **collaborative Agile environments** through [Chingu](https://www.chingu.io/), where I've contributed to full development cycles as part of international dev teams.

## About Me

I'm always exploring new ways to grow as a developer, currently focusing on **React**, **TypeScript**, **unit testing**, and writing clean, efficient code.

I'm actively learning:
- Front-end best practices with guidance from [Martin Stadler](https://mentorcruise.com/mentor/martinstadler/)
- Data structures and algorithms through 1:1 tutoring with [Greem L.](https://www.wyzant.com/match/tutor/89018372)

Outside of coding, I love hiking with my miniature poodle and Latin dancing on the weekends.
