# Hi, I'm Ivan Rebolledo

**Frontend Developer | React • TypeScript • Next.js**

I'm a Front-End Developer focusing on React, TypeScript, JavaScript, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Material UI. I've built various applications, including a stock dashboard with local caching, a developer resources app featuring fuzzy search, and an AI prompt builder.

I have collaborated in Agile teams through Chingu, where I contributed to creating four different applications. My responsibilities included managing state with the Context API and local storage, developing logic to filter dishes for the Weekly Bytes app, creating forms, and utilizing libraries like React Select for drop-down menus and Fuse.js for a smart search bar.
