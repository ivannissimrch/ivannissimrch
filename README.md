## About Me

I love learning about front-end development technologies and creating applications. I'm currently focused on improving my coding skills with the guidance of my mentor [Martin Stadler](https://mentorcruise.com/mentor/martinstadler/?queryID=b9e92f8896ce0ca6073026eac3ac3a7c&source=search) and by collaborating on teams building applications at [Chingu](https://www.chingu.io/). Besides coding, I love taking my miniature poodle on hikes on the weekends and I enjoy Latin dancing.
